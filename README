Harmattan SMS Boat
==================

An exporter for SMS/Calls from Harmattan to a semi CSV structure

The resulting CSV is written to a file encoded as utf-8 in the format:
PhoneNumber;IN/OUT;StartTime;EndTime;SMSText

Calls have a similar format:
PhoneNumber;IN/OUT;MISSED/OK;StartTime;EndTime

If the SMSText contains newlines a space is added after the newline
--> lines starting with a space are a continuation of the last sms text.

The times(dates) are formatted with Qt::ISODate, excerpt from the Qt 5 docs:
ISO 8601 extended format: either YYYY-MM-DD for dates or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSTZD
(e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00) for combined dates and times.

Sample csv (for sms):
+xxxxxxxxx;IN;2013-11-29T08:07:09Z;2013-11-29T08:07:49Z;Your jolla dev kit is on it's way!
 Should be there by tomorrow
+xxxxxxxxx;OUT;2013-11-29T07:11:42Z;2013-11-29T07:11:40Z;Thanks m8

cd /srv/mer/targets/SailfishOS-armv7hl
sb2 -t SailfishOS-armv7hl -m sdk-install -R zypper in libcommhistory-qt5-devel
