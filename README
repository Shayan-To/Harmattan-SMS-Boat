Harmattan SMS Boat
==================

An exporter for SMS from Harmattan to a semi CSV structure

The resulting CSV is printed to STDOUT in the format:
PhoneNumber;IN/OUT;StartTime;EndTime;SMSText

If the SMSText contains newlines a space is added after the newline
--> lines starting with a space are a continuation of the last sms text.

Building/Installing
===================

The n9 exporter must be built inside a harmattan scratchbox.
Also libcommhistory-dev must be installed inside scratchbox.

cd n9Export
qmake
make
