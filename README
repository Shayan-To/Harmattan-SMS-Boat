Harmattan SMS Boat
==================

An exporter for SMS from Harmattan to a semi CSV structure

The resulting CSV is printed to STDOUT in the format:
PhoneNumber;IN/OUT;StartTime;EndTime;SMSText

If the SMSText contains newlines a space is added after the newline
--> lines starting with a space are a continuation of the last sms text.
